# PR Description Examples

This file contains examples of boring vs engaging PR descriptions to demonstrate the preferred writing style.

## Example 1: Email Validation Fix

### 😴 Boring (don't do this)

```markdown
## Summary

Modified validation logic.
Updated tests.
Fixed edge case.
```

### 🎉 Engaging (do this)

```markdown
## Summary

Rewrote the email validation to handle all those weird edge cases we kept hitting! 🎯

- ✅ Now supports plus addressing (user+tag@example.com)
- ✅ Handles international domains correctly
- ✅ Added 15 new test cases for the tricky stuff
- 🐛 Fixed the bug where empty strings were passing validation (oops!)

## Why This Matters

Users were getting frustrated when their perfectly valid emails were rejected. Turns out our regex from 2015 wasn't cutting it anymore. This brings us up to RFC 5322 compliance and should handle 99% of real-world email formats.

## The Tricky Part

International domain names were a pain - had to use punycode conversion. Not the prettiest solution, but it works reliably across all browsers.

Fixes #156
```

## Example 2: Feature - Dark Mode

### 😴 Boring

```markdown
Added dark mode.
Created toggle component.
Updated theme variables.
```

### 🎉 Engaging

```markdown
## Summary

Finally bringing dark mode to life! 🌙✨

The community has been asking for this since forever, and it's ready to ship:

- 🎨 Complete dark color palette with semantic tokens
- 🔄 Smooth theme switching with CSS variable swaps
- 💾 Persists user preference to localStorage
- ♿ Respects system prefers-color-scheme
- 📦 New `<ThemeToggle>` component anyone can drop in

## How It Works

Instead of duplicating styles, we're using CSS custom properties that swap values based on a `[data-theme="dark"]` attribute on the root element. This means zero runtime overhead and instant theme switching! Pretty neat.

## What's Next

This lays the groundwork for user-customizable themes in the future. Right now it's just light/dark, but the architecture supports any number of themes.

Fixes #42
```

## Example 3: Performance Optimization

### 😴 Boring (Performance)

```markdown
Optimized table rendering.
Implemented virtual scrolling.
```

### 🎉 Engaging (Performance)

```markdown
## Summary

Massively improved table performance for large datasets! ⚡

- 📊 Virtual scrolling now handles 10k+ rows smoothly
- 🎯 Reduced initial render time by 60%
- 🧪 Added performance benchmarks to prevent regressions

## The Problem

Users with large datasets were experiencing 3-5 second load times and janky scrolling. Not a great experience when you're trying to analyze data quickly.

## The Solution

Implemented virtual scrolling using a windowing technique - we only render rows visible in the viewport plus a small buffer. As you scroll, rows are recycled instead of created from scratch.

## Benchmarks

Before: ~4200ms to render 5000 rows
After: ~180ms to render 5000 rows

That's a 23x improvement! 🚀

Fixes #234
```

## Example 4: Refactoring

### 😴 Boring (Refactoring)

```markdown
Refactored authentication code.
Moved functions to utilities.
```

### 🎉 Engaging (Refactoring)

```markdown
## Summary

Cleaned up the authentication flow and made it way more maintainable 🧹

- ♻️ Extracted token validation into reusable utilities
- 🎯 Reduced code duplication across 5 different modules
- ✅ Added comprehensive unit tests (coverage went from 40% to 95%)

## Why This Refactor

The auth code was scattered across multiple files, making it hard to track down bugs and add new features. Every time we needed to validate a token, we were copy-pasting the same logic.

## What Changed

Created a central `auth-utils` module that handles all the token validation, refresh logic, and expiry checks. Now all modules use the same battle-tested code.

## No Breaking Changes

This is purely internal refactoring - the public API remains unchanged. All existing tests still pass plus we added a bunch more.
```

## Example 5: Breaking Change

### 😴 Boring (Breaking)

```markdown
Changed API endpoints.
Updated authentication.
```

### 🎉 Engaging (Breaking)

```markdown
## Summary

⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE**: Redesigned authentication flow

This is a significant change that affects how authentication works across the entire app:

- 🔐 Switched from session-based to JWT token authentication
- 🔄 Added refresh token rotation for better security
- 📦 New `/api/auth/token` endpoint replaces `/api/auth/login`
- 🗑️ Removed deprecated `/api/auth/session` endpoint

## Why The Breaking Change

Session-based auth was causing scaling issues and didn't work well with our microservices architecture. JWT tokens allow for stateless authentication and make it easier to scale horizontally.

## Migration Guide

If you're currently using the old authentication:

1. Replace login calls:

   ```diff
   - POST /api/auth/login
   + POST /api/auth/token
   ```

1. Update token storage:

   ```diff
   - Store session cookie
   + Store JWT token in localStorage or httpOnly cookie
   ```

1. Add token refresh logic:

   ```javascript
   // Refresh token before expiry
   await refreshToken(currentToken);
   ```

## Testing

- ✅ All unit tests updated
- ✅ Integration tests pass
- ✅ Tested migration path with staging environment

BREAKING CHANGE: Authentication now uses JWT tokens instead of sessions. See migration guide above.

Fixes #567
```

## Example 6: Draft/WIP PR

```markdown
## Summary

🚧 **[WIP] Work in progress** - New dashboard implementation

This is a draft PR to get early feedback on the dashboard architecture. Not ready to merge yet!

What's done:
- ✅ Basic layout structure
- ✅ Chart components scaffolding
- ✅ Data fetching hooks

Still TODO:
- ⏳ Implement actual chart rendering
- ⏳ Add filters and controls
- ⏳ Write tests
- ⏳ Optimize performance

## Questions for Reviewers

1. Does this component structure make sense?
2. Should we use library X or library Y for charts?
3. Any concerns about the data fetching approach?

Feel free to leave comments even though it's not complete!
